To improve the medical response and treatment of seizures, and ultimately improve peopleâ€™s lives affected by seizures, diagnosis of seizures must be improved. 
# Goal
To goal for this project was to improve the classification of seizures based off of brain wave activity. 
## Exploratory Data Analysis
To do this, we started with Data processing and Data exploration to fully understand the data provided. 
## Algorithms 
We then performed a logistic regression with varying hyperparameters. 
Next we executed K Nearest Neighbors with different distance metrics. 
We then performed Decision Trees and Random Forests with pruning techniques. 
Finally, we executed a convolutional neural network and evaluated our algorithms.
